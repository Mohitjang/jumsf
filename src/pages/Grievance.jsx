            The company commits and assures to provide the best possible recourse to resolve the grievance.
            Below are the steps which the customer needs to take for resolving his/her grievances:
          </p>
          <p>1. The customer needs to lodge a complaint/grievance by sending a mail
            to <a href="mailto:info@flik.co.in"><b><u>info@flik.co.in</u></b></a> with subject line “Complaint &amp;
            Grievance Register”. The company shall
            respond to the complaint within 7 working days, from the date of receipt/lodgement of
            complaint. The company on receipt of the complaint shall examine the same and accordingly
            communicate in writing/email/phone, its response on the same to the customer or else
            suitable justification shall be provided in case the resolution of the complaint requires more
            than the time stipulated above.</p>
          <p>
            2. If the customer is still not satisfied with the response received, or if the customer doesn’t
            receive any response within 7 working days, then the customer can email to the Nodal
            Grievance Redressal Officer of the company as mentioned below:
